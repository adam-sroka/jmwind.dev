A friend once asked for permission to share my email with someone who could use my help. I said "you're living in the 90s" by asking.

My DMs are always open.

It doesn't cost much to ignore DMs, so instead I optimize to hear from anyone. I've met amazing people in my DMs and some are still friends. You learn a ton. I love the internet.

I can't promise to get back to everyone. If I'm busy or sailing, it's quite possible that there's no time. But I'll read everything at some point and who knows...
