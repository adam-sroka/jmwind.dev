            You can't improve what you can't see. Many engineering leaders 
            struggle to make key decisions because they aren't looking closely enough.

            My passion is to highlights common patterns in technical teams, dig into the nuances, 
            and provide tools to help you make the hard decisions that build great engineering organizasions.
