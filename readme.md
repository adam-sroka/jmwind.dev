# Personal Website

Survival of the simplest. 

This is a ode to a simpler web. My personal website is a single html using a static [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) css file and is published and hosted via
[Vercel](https://vercel.com).

Website is hosted at [buildrightside.com](https://buildrightside.com).

## Installation

There are no dependencies to install outside of a modern web browser ðŸ¤¯. Oh, well there is one local install for the Tailwind CLI:

```bash
npm install -g tailwindcss
```

Then generate the css as follows

```bash
npx tailwindcss -o styles.css --minify
```

Then open the index.html file in your browser.
