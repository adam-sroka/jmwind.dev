# Personal and Book Website

Survival of the simplest. Well it used to be, but then migrated to astro.build.

Built with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), [Astro](https://astro.build), and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Super simple setup.

Website is hosted at [buildrightside.com](https://buildrightside.com).
