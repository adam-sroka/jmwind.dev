                I'm a nerd. In the past 30 years we've seen a shift in companies being led by dealmakers to technicians
                — from the
                charismatic to the nerds. Most boards and advisors helping
                these companies have dealmaker
                backgrounds, my focus is to help the technician led companies succeed with mentoring from a fellow nerd
                who's built
                companies, products, and platforms at scale... while having fun!

                    While advising founders, execs, and CTOs I found that the bulk of the questions and discussions 
                    are the same. I've collected the top ones where the answers are counter intuitive and require changes 
                    in how you view yourself and the world around you.

                        2005</a> and we updated and released a 2nd edition in 2010. It was both painful and one of the
                    most rewarding experiences of my life. At the time my
                    kids were aged 1 and 3 so the timing was very suboptimal. I swore, never again.

                    Fast forward 17 years later and the kids are away and time has returned. Writing is possible again
